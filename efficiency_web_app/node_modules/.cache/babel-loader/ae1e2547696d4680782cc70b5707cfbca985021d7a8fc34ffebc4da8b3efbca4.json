In medieval Europe, the concept of policing evolved through various means, \n        including the watch system and the establishment of constabularies tasked with enforcing local laws and regulations.\n       </p>\n       <p>\n       However, modern policing as we know it today began to take shape in the 19th century,\n        particularly with the establishment of the London Metropolitan Police by Sir Robert Peel in 1829. \n        Peel's principles of policing emphasized the importance of community cooperation, crime prevention, \n        and professionalism among officers, laying the foundation for modern law enforcement practices. \n        As industrialization and urbanization accelerated, police forces expanded in size and scope, \n       grappling with new challenges posed by organized crime, civil unrest, and technological advancements.\n       </p>\n       <p>\n       Throughout the 20th century, police departments underwent significant reforms and adaptations in response to changing societal dynamics, \n       including the civil rights movement, the rise of drug trafficking, and advancements in forensic science. Today, \n       police departments around the world continue to evolve, embracing community-oriented policing strategies,\n        incorporating technology for crime prevention and investigation,\n        and striving to uphold the principles of justice, fairness, and accountability in their service to society.\n       </p>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"mission-section\">\n        <h3>Executive Team</h3>\n        <div className='innerdiv'>\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          <h3>Chief of Police or Commissioner</h3>\n          <p>\n            The highest-ranking officer responsible for overseeing all departmental operations, setting strategic goals, and representing the department to the public and government officials.\n          </p>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <h3>Deputy Chief</h3>\n          <p>\n            Assists the Chief in managing day-to-day operations, strategic planning, and decision-making.
